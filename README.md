## Installation

Provide clear and concise instructions on how to set up and run the project locally. This will vary depending on your chosen technologies. Here are some general steps you might include:

**For Frontend (React Native example):**

1.  Ensure you have Node.js and npm (or yarn) installed on your system.
2.  Install the Expo CLI globally: `npm install -g expo-cli` or `yarn global add expo-cli`
3.  Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo-name.git`
4.  Navigate to the project directory: `cd your-repo-name`
5.  Install dependencies: `npm install` or `yarn install`
6.  Start the application: `npm start` or `yarn start` (This will likely open a QR code or a development server URL).

**For Backend (Node.js example):**

1.  Ensure you have Node.js and npm (or yarn) installed on your system.
2.  Navigate to the backend directory (if separate): `cd backend`
3.  Install dependencies: `npm install` or `yarn install`
4.  Configure environment variables (e.g., API keys for OCR/NLP services, database connection details) in a `.env` file.
5.  Start the backend server: `npm start` or `node server.js` (or your main server file).

**Database Setup:**

1.  Provide instructions on how to set up your chosen database (e.g., install MongoDB, create a PostgreSQL database).
2.  Explain any necessary database migrations or seed data setup.

**API Key Configuration:**

1.  If you are using external OCR or NLP services, explain how to obtain and configure the necessary API keys.

## Configuration

Mention any important configuration files or environment variables that need to be set up (e.g., API keys, database URLs, application settings).

## Usage

Provide a brief overview of how to use the application, highlighting key workflows like uploading a resume, viewing extracted information, and using search/filter functionalities. You can include screenshots or GIFs to illustrate the user interface.
